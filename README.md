# poker

A Clojure implementation of a poker game ([Texas Hold 'em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em)) and a corresponding Discord bot to play poker in chat.

This is (roughly) how the logic part is used:
```clojure
(require '[poker.logic.game :as poker]
         '[poker.logic.core :as cards])

(def player-budgets {"Alice" 100 "Bob" 85})
(def game (poker/start-game 10 (keys player-budgets) (shuffle cards/deck) player-budgets))

; Available functions
(poker/possible-moves game)
(poker/call game)
(poker/raise game 20)
(poker/fold game)
(poker/all-in game)
```

## Bot

Here are a few impressions of what it looks like:

The bot is public, you can invite it [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=461791942779338762&permissions=329792&scope=bot).

I'm still looking for a way to host the bot long term, other than that, its functionality is near complete.

If you can't wait and want to use it now, you are free to host and try it yourself:
1. Get [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)
2. Clone this repo
3. Put a `cofig.clj` file in the repo that looks like this:
```clj
{:token           "TOKEN"
 :wait-time       25000   ; The number of milliseconds to wait for players when starting a game
 :default-buy-in  1000    ; The default buy-in if none is specified when running "holdem!"
 :timeout         180000} ; The number of milliseconds after which the current player, if they have not made a move, will fold automatically
```
4. Run `lein run`
